This is a repository analyzing greenhouse gas emissions data catalogued since 1990 until 2021. The data comes from New York State, and it has been used to inform public policy decisions in New York.

The repository contains a python script which was used to generate a filtered version of the original data, focusing on the transportation sector. The repo also comes along with the original data in a csv along with the filtered data in csv format.


An example usage of this filtered data is making a visualization like the following:

This is just one use of the data, comparing usage of different gases in the transport sector, but there are many other avenues for further analysis in the filtered data set.

This data is for climate activists, journalists, and any one interested in climate science looking for data.

Users are free to download the csv files used in this repository for further analysis of their own agency.
